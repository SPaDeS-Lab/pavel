Pavel received his bachelor’s degree (2008) in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Dhaka, Bangladesh. He earned his master’s (2016) and Ph.D. (2020) in Computer Science from the University of Kentucky. Pavel’s work in general focuses on the security and fault tolerance of distributed computing systems. His aim is to devise novel schemes, algorithms, and protocols that support the development of secure, reliable, and trustworthy distributed networks (e.g., cloud, edge, and vehicular networks). His research supports these undertakings, and he always thrives to design and deliver practical approaches to problems being experienced in industry or society. Other than the above areas, Pavel would also like to investigate new research topics in closely related areas such as, mobile cloud, sensor network, software-defined network, Internet of things (IoT), and block chain-based distributed systems."/><meta property="og:type" content="article"/><meta property="og:url" content="https://paveltariq.com/"/><meta property="og:url" content="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oaquHmoAAAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;oi=ao"/><meta property="og:title" content="Md Tariqul Islam &#x27;Pavel&#x27; - iSchool | Syracuse University"/><meta property="og:description" content="Md Tariqul Islam &#x27;Pavel&#x27; - iSchool | Syracuse University Assistant Professor 323C Hinds Hall"/><meta property="og:image" content="https://paveltariq.com/pavel-thumb.png"/><meta property="og:image:secure_url" content="https://paveltariq.com/pavel-thumb.png"/><meta name="twitter:image:src" content="https://paveltariq.com/pavel-thumb.png"/><meta property="article:author" content="Md Tariqul Islam Pavel"/><meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image"/><meta name="twitter:site" content="iSchoolSU"/><meta name="twitter:title" content="Md Tariqul Islam - iSchool | Syracuse University"/><meta name="twitter:description" content="Assistant Professor323C Hinds Hall"/><link rel="preload" href="/_next/static/css/b201e9a1945c975c.css" as="style"/><link rel="stylesheet" href="/_next/static/css/b201e9a1945c975c.css" data-n-g=""/><noscript data-n-css=""></noscript><script defer="" nomodule="" src="/_next/static/chunks/polyfills-c67a75d1b6f99dc8.js"></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/webpack-8fa1640cc84ba8fe.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/framework-114634acb84f8baa.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/main-7209515590abf48c.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/_app-5b8975cead027a18.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/996-c5e5aa4c30f33066.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/chunks/pages/research-9ba51cf4b0c9a24d.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/SckS0whV0Uv-yO-wPc63U/_buildManifest.js" defer=""></script><script src="/_next/static/SckS0whV0Uv-yO-wPc63U/_ssgManifest.js" defer=""></script></head><body><div id="__next"><div><nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg fixed-top glossy-nav"><div class="container"><div class="title-brand"><div><strong>Md Tariqul Islam</strong> &#x27;Pavel&#x27;</div></div><button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNavDropdown" aria-controls="navbarNavDropdown" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation"><span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span></button><span class="collapse navbar-collapse justify-content-end" id="navbarNavDropdown"><ul class="nav nav-pills"><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link custom-pills text-dark" href="/">Home</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link bg-dark custom-pills active" href="/research">Research</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link custom-pills text-dark" href="/publications">Publications</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link custom-pills text-dark" href="/spades-lab">♠️ SPaDeS Lab</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link custom-pills text-dark" href="/teaching">Teaching</a></li><li class="nav-item"><a class="nav-link custom-pills text-dark" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferer" href="/CV_April_2024.pdf">CV</a></li></ul></span></div></nav><div class="container main-content"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-8"><div class="row justify-content-center"><div class="col-md-12">During his Ph.D. research, Pavel had developed several prototypes of cloud storage using cryptographic protocols that ensure security, privacy, and fault tolerance. He intends to further revise and enhance these prototypes to accomplish his future research plans. His research offers opportunities to work on building novel security algorithms and fault tolerant solutions for cloud and vehicular networks. Following are the most recent research projects he had worked on.<br/><br/><b>SecReS:</b> Since data and storage are outsourced to third party service providers, users lose direct control of data management and have to depend solely on the providers who may not always be dependable. This distinctive feature therefore poses numerous security threats and vulnerabilities. To address these issues, we proposed SecReS (Secure and Reliable Storage)– a cloud storage scheme that simultaneously achieves security, reliability, and deduplication. SecReS blends convergent encryption and perfect secret sharing scheme to achieve confidentiality of data and encryption keys. It also achieves fault tolerance by dispersing data to multiple storage servers using Reed-Solomon erasure code. SecReS uses Merkle hash tree to authenticate users by verifying Proof of Ownership (PoW) of data for carrying out secure deduplication.<!-- --> <br/><br/><b>CP-ABCE:</b> To overcome the inherent limitations of convergent encryption and its vulnerability to several side-channel attacks (e.g., “confirmation-of-a-file” attack and “learn-the-remaining-information” attack), we proposed a storage scheme named CP-ABCE (Ciphertext Policy Attribute-Based Convergent Encryption). It blends convergent encryption with an attribute-based encryption scheme to ensure confidentiality and deduplication. The convergent encryption guarantees that only a single copy of data is stored at the server, and thus reduces the amount of data need to be transferred, stored, and managed by storage provider. In our scheme, users’ keys are specified by a set of attributes while the entity encrypting the data can specify an access control policy over these attributes so that only a specific set of users are able to decrypt.<br/><br/><b>FaCS:</b> Large-scale cloud datacenters often experience reduced performance and service outage. Due to the inherent complexity, heterogeneity, and multitenant architecture of these datacenters, applications (i.e., jobs and tasks) running on them are susceptible to various types of failures. In this project, we first characterize the application failures in Google cluster trace and then propose a prediction model which can forecast the termination status of a task. Then, we introduce a task scheduler named FaCS (A Fault-tolerant Cloud Scheduler) that dynamically reschedules tasks based on the predicted results. This proactive fault-tolerant scheduler improves system reliability and ensures timely execution of the applications. Simulation results show that FaCS reduces makespan and failure rates of tasks substantially while balancing load at the same time. Moreover, early prediction along with quick scheduling adjustment improves overall resource utilization and reduces resource wastage.</div></div><div class="row my-5"><div>Copyright © 2024<br/><small><b>Last updated on December 6, 2024</b></small></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/research","query":{},"buildId":"SckS0whV0Uv-yO-wPc63U","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
